# LTW Project
This repository is a mirror of the original private repository for this project.
The project consisted of making a ticket website where one can post a ticket and admins/agents can help resolve the issue.
It was made for the Linguagens e Tecnologias Web UC in the second year of LEIC at FEUP.

# Running
You can initialize the php server with ```php -S localhost:9000``` and then type ```localhost:9000``` in your search bar to access the site.
